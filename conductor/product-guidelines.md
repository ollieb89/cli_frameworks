# Communication Style

## Tone and Voice
- **User-Selectable Personalities:** The CLI must offer a choice of personalities (e.g., Witty & Engaging vs. Crisp & Technical) to suit the user's current working style or mood.
- **Witty & Engaging (Default):** The default tone should be conversational, expressive, and high-energy, perfectly aligning with the "vibe-coding" aesthetic. It should use emojis and maintain a helpful, partner-like presence.
- **Empowering Messaging:** Every interaction should focus on empowering the user, emphasizing their agency and the "superpowers" the AI provides.

## Error and Warning Handling
- **Graceful and Explanatory:** Errors should never be silent or cryptic. The CLI must provide clear, contextual explanations of what went wrong and, where possible, offer actionable suggested fixes.
- **Honest Feedback:** Build trust by being transparent about limitations, potential risks, and the reasoning behind AI-generated decisions.

# Visual Identity (TUI)

## Symbols and Iconography
- **Rich Symbolism:** Utilize an extensive and consistent set of emojis/symbols (e.g., 🎯 for targets, ⚡ for performance, 🛡️ for security) to represent technical domains, task status, and progress. This improves scanability and enhances the "vibe."
- **Status Indicators:** Use specific symbols (e.g., ✅, ❌, ⚠️, 🔄) to provide instant visual feedback on the success or failure of operations.

## Interactive Elements
- **Dynamic Progress:** For long-running operations, use interactive components like progress bars, spinners/loaders, and dynamic tables to keep the user informed and engaged.
- **Modern Aesthetic:** The interface should reflect a cutting-edge "future of coding" feel, using clean layouts and thoughtful spacing within the terminal.
